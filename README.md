# Recipe Finder Website

**Check out the website**: http://i488547.hera.fhict.nl/foodRecipe/index.html 

**Introduction**

For a school assignment, I needed to create a fully responsive website that incorporates the use of an API and SCSS. This was my first time ever coding with API, so I learned a lot and managed to do a Recipe Finder website.

With my website, you can find recipes by searching up an ingredient or a dish. You can also filter out what meal you want to get recipes for, such as breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. Each recipe also shows you the total calories and other nutrional value. Lastly, when you click on a recipe, it will redirect you to an external site for the recipe.

**Tools & Technology**

- [Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api), the Recipe Search API & JSON
- Media queries
- ES6+
- SCSS
- JSDoc Comments for Docummentation

**Process**

I first researched about API's and look at what API's are out there. I found the Edamam one and wanted to give it a try, because it was food related. The implementation was relatively easy as the API Documentation was pretty good, so I didn't have much troubLe with it, except maybe retrieving the nutrional value part. This was because they were JSON nested arrays, and it was my first time processing JSON data. After succesful implementation of the API, I started working on the UI and learned how to do the styling in SCSS. In the end, I made the entire site responsive with media queries and also improve my code based on teacher's feedback.
